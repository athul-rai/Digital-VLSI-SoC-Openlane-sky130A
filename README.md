## Physical Design using OpenLANE & Sky130 PDK

## üìò Project Introduction
This project documents the complete physical design (PD) flow for a `picorv32a` RISC-V core, from RTL to a final GDSII layout. It leverages the fully automated, open-source **OpenLANE** framework and the **Skywater 130nm (Sky130) PDK**. This work was completed as part of the Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning Workshop by VLSI System Design (VSD) Corp, providing a practical, hands-on journey through the entire chip implementation process.

OpenLANE orchestrates a suite of powerful EDA tools‚Äîincluding Yosys, OpenROAD, Magic, and Netgen‚Äîto automate the entire flow, from logic synthesis to final layout generation, enabling the efficient creation of hard macros and full chip designs.

# DAY-1
# Inception-of-Open-source-EDA,OpenLane-and-Sky130-PDK

we explore the fundamental physical elements of an integrated circuit (IC) : 

**Package, Chip, Pads, Core, Die, and IPs** : 
- The QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-lead) package is a surface-mounted IC package with 48 pins used to connect the chip to the outside world.

- Inside the package is the die, the actual silicon chip where transistors are fabricated.

- The core is the functional part of the die where the logic (e.g., processor, memory) is implemented.

- Surrounding the core are pads, which act as electrical contact points for interfacing signals from the core to the pins on the package.
  
- The chip as a whole includes the die, package, and connections.

The core of the chip will contain two types of blocks:

**Foundry IP Blocks** (e.g. ADC, DAC, PLL, and SRAM) = blocks which requires some amount of intelligent techniques to build which can only be designed by foundries.

**Macro blocks** (e.g. RISC-V SOC and SPI) = pure digital logic blocks compared to IP's which might require some analog parts.

## Introduction to RISC-V

- RISC-V stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing ‚Äì Version 5 and is designed with simplicity and modularity in mind.

- Unlike proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86, RISC-V is open, meaning anyone can implement or modify it freely.

- The architecture consists of a base integer set and optional extensions (e.g., for multiplication, atomic operations, floating point).

- RISC-V is ideal for education, research, and industrial design due to its transparency and scalability.

## Simplified RTL to GDSII Flow 

*Synthesis*

The Register Transfer Level (RTL) code, typically written in Verilog or VHDL, is translated into a gate-level netlist. This netlist is composed of logic gates and components from a pre-defined standard cell library. These cells have fixed sizes and electrical characteristics, provided by the Process Design Kit (PDK). During synthesis, optimizations such as constant propagation, logic simplification, and technology mapping are performed to ensure an area-efficient and logically equivalent design.

*Floor Planning and Power Planning*

This step involves defining the physical layout of the chip, including the die area, core area, margins, and reserved regions for IP blocks or macros. Floorplanning also includes decisions on I/O pin placement and defining power domains.
In power planning, a Power Distribution Network (PDN) is created to deliver clean power across the chip. The power rails and straps are usually placed on upper metal layers since they are thicker and have lower resistance, which helps reduce IR drop and ensures reliable power delivery.

*Placement*

Placement determines the exact physical location of standard cells within the defined floorplan. This process occurs in two phases:

- Global Placement: Estimates optimal positions to reduce wirelength and congestion, but may not obey all design rules.

- Detailed Placement: Adjusts the global result to ensure legal placement while minimizing additional wirelength or timing penalties.

*Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)*

A clock tree is built to distribute the clock signal to all sequential elements (flip-flops) in the design. Since all flip-flops must receive the clock signal simultaneously to avoid timing violations like skew and jitter, structures such as H-trees or X-trees are used. CTS also buffers the clock signal and ensures balanced timing paths across different regions.

*Routing*

Routing connects the logically associated pins (nets) across the placed cells using horizontal and vertical metal layers defined in the PDK.

- Global Routing identifies approximate routing paths.

- Detailed Routing determines exact wiring with specific tracks, vias, and metal layers.
 
- The Sky130 PDK provides six metal layers, each with defined widths, spacings, pitches, and via rules to guide the router for legal and             manufacturable connections.

*Verification Before Sign-off*

Before the final design is ready for fabrication, several verification steps are required:

- DRC (Design Rule Check): Ensures the physical layout complies with all foundry-imposed rules like minimum spacing, width, enclosure, etc.

- LVS (Layout Versus Schematic): Compares the layout netlist against the schematic/netlist from the synthesis phase to confirm logical equivalence.

- Timing Analysis: Static Timing Analysis (STA) verifies that all setup and hold time constraints are satisfied across all paths and corners         (process, voltage, temperature).
The final Result is [GDSII file format.](https://anysilicon.com/semipedia/gdsii/)

RTL to GDSII flow : [Openlane](https://efabless.com/openlane)

## OpenLane Flow

<img width="848" height="=500" alt="182759711-6b9352ec-7652-4589-af31-53a409eb2830" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3cdde11-73e1-496e-9486-3d02f62ff65d"/>


OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow that utilizes various components such as OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, and custom scripts for design exploration and optimization.

The flow performs all ASIC implementation steps from RTL down to GDSII. OpenLane Interactive Mode Commands include a variety of functions such as setting the current netlist, running logic verification, setting the current def file, preparing lef files, preparing a liberty file, generating an exclude list file, sourcing configurations, specifying a path to save config_in.tcl, preparing a run, specifying a design folder, overwriting an existing run, specifying a path to save the run, specifying a name for a specific run, creating a tcl configuration file for a design, setting the verilog source code file, specifying the design's configuration file, setting a verbose output level, generating a padframe, saving views of a given run, changing save paths for various file types, labeling pins of a macro def, generating a verilog netlist from a def file, creating an obstruction, setting tracks on a layer, extracting core dimensions, running SPEF extraction and Static Timing Analysis, running antenna checks, saving environment variables, running OpenSTA timing analysis, checking for unmapped cells, checking for assign statements, and checking if the LEF was properly read.

- *Antenna Rules Violation* : long wire segments will act as antennna and will accumulate charges, this might damage the connected transistor gates. Solution is to either use bridging or antenna diode insertion to leak away the charges.  
### OpenLane Directory Hierarchy:

 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OOpenLane             -> directory where the tool can be invoked (run docker first)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ designs          -> All designs must be extracted from this folder
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ picorv32a -> Design used as case study for this workshop
‚îÇ   |   |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
|   |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pdks                 -> contains pdk related files 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skywater-pdk     -> all Skywater 130nm PDKs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ open-pdks        -> contains scripts that makes the commerical PDK (which is normally just compatible to commercial tools) to also be compatible with the open-source EDA tool
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sky130A          -> pdk variant made especially compatible for open-source tools
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libs.ref  -> files specific to node process (timing lib, cell lef, tech lef) for example is `sky130_fd_sc_hd` (Sky130nm Foundry Standard Cell High Density)  
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libs.tech -> files specific for the tool (klayout,netgen,magic...) 


Inside a specific design folder contains a config.tcl which overrides the default settings on OpenLANE. These configurations are specific to a design (e.g. clock period, clock port, verilog files...). The priority order for the OpenLANE settings:
1. sky130_xxxxx_config.tcl in OpenLane/designs/[design]/
2. config.tcl in OpenLane/designs/[design]/
3. Default values in OpenLane/configuration/



### Lab [Day 1] - Determine Flip-flop Ratio:
The task is to find the flip-flop ratio ratio for the design picorv32a. This is the ratio of the number of flip flops to the total number of cells. For the OpenLane installation, the steps are very straight forward and can be found on the [OpenLane repo](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane).

*1. Run OpenLANE:*
 - $ make mount = Open the docker platform inside the openlane/
 - % flow.tcl -interactive = run script for automating the whole RTL to GDSII flow but in step by step -interactive mode
 - % package require openlane 0.9 == retrives all dependencies for running v0.9 of OpenLANE  
 
 ![GDS Layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/athul-rai/Digital-VLSI-SoC-Openlane-sky130A/main/Day1/Screenshot%202025-07-31%20123740.png)


 
*2. Design Setup Stage:*
 - % prep -design picorv32a = Setup the filesystem where the OpenLANE tools can dump the outputs. This also creates a run/ folder inside the specific design directory which contains the command log files, results, and the reports dump by each tools. These folders will be empty for now except for lef files generated by this design setup stage. This merged the [cell LEF files](https://teamvlsi.com/2020/05/lef-lef-file-in-asic-design.html) .lef and [technology LEF files](https://teamvlsi.com/2020/05/lef-lef-file-in-asic-design.html) .tlef generating merged.nom.lef inside run/tmp/
 

![GDS Layout 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/athul-rai/Digital-VLSI-SoC-Openlane-sky130A/main/Day1/Screenshot%202025-07-31%20123906.png)

*3. Run synthesis:*
 - % run_synthesis = Run yosys RTL synthesis, ABC scripts (for technology mapping), and OpenSTA.  
 
![Flip-Flop Ratio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/athul-rai/Digital-VLSI-SoC-Openlane-sky130A/main/Day1/flip-flop-ratio.png)

*The flipflop ratio is (number of flip flops)/(total number of cells) is 1613/14876 = 0.10843. Or 10.843%*

#### Slack 

refers to the difference between the required arrival time and the actual arrival time of a signal. If the signal arrives earlier than required, it's called positive slack, indicating the design meets timing. If it arrives later, it's negative slack, meaning a timing violation has occurred. Positive slack is desirable, while negative slack must be fixed to ensure reliable circuit operation.

In Order to fix negetive slack we change the clock period to ```55.00``` in ```sky130_xxxxx_config.tcl```

# Day 2 
##The following topics are addresed:

Floorplanning
- Calculating utilization factor (area occupied by netlist / total area of core) and aspect ratio of the core (height/width)
- Defining pre-placed cells location, which are placed before standard cells
- Usage of decoupling capacitor to counter fluctuation of power delivered to cells and noise, which can cause undefined logic values and unstable circuit functioning
- Power planning to provide power to cells

Placement
- Bind netlist to physical cells and determine size. On library, one can find same cells of different sizes depending on the needs of the circuit
- Place the netlist on the core, respecting preplaced cells and finding the best locations to guarantee signal integrity and physical proximity to where the signals should travel
- Place repeaters to strenghten signals of cells that are distant

Cell design flow
- Standard cells are kept at a library, such as AND, inverter, buffer, etc
- For inputs of the flow: PDKs, DRC and LVS rules, SPICE models, library and uuser defined specs
- It has some design steps: circuit design, layout and characterization
- Then, for output, we get circuit description language (CDL) files, GDSII, LEF, extracted SPICE netlist (.cir), timing, noise, power libs and function
- For the characterization flow, the cell's behavior should be analyzed under various conditions as to create implementation models

Timing characterization
- One should note the various timing threshold definitions, such as the slew, how much time the cell takes to respond to an input and the corresponding outputs
- The propagation delay is also crucial to compare how the output in a cell behaves to an input, as the different delays in communicating cells can cause unexpected results if not properly addressed
- Transition time points at the slew time of inputs and outputs, calculated using the threshold values
- The waveforms are a way for visualization of this step

#### Fix Tech File DRC via Magic


All technology-specific information comes from a technology file. This file includes such information as layer types used, electrical connectivity between types,     design rules, rules for mask generation, and rules for extracting netlists for circuit simulation - [DRC rules for SKY130nm PDK](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/rules/periphery.html#rules-periphery--page-root)

Clone custom inverter standard cell design :

```
# Change directory to openlane
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# Clone the repository with custom inverter design
git clone https://github.com/nickson-jose/vsdstdcelldesign

# Change into repository directory
cd vsdstdcelldesign
 
# Copy magic tech file to the repo directory for easy access
cp /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech .

# Check contents whether everything is present
ls

# Command to open custom inverter layout in magic
magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag &
```

- Inside the drc_tests/ are the .mag layout files and the sky130A.tech.
- Open magic with ```poly.mag``` as input: magic poly.mag from file --> open
- Focus on Incorrect poly.9.the spacing between polyresistor with poly or diff/tap must at least be 0.480um. Using command box in console, we can see that   the distance violated but there is no DRC violations shown. Our goal is to fix the tech file to include that DRC.

The current sky130A.tech file only includes spacing rules for:

- n-poly resistor to n-diffusion

- p-poly resistor to p-diffusion

We are now adding two new critical spacing rules (highlighted in green):

- Left rule: Spacing between n-poly resistor and regular poly (non-resistor)

- Right rule: Spacing between p-poly resistor and regular poly (non-resistor)

These additions ensure proper isolation between resistor and non-resistor poly layers in the design

To apply the new poly resistor spacing rules:

Run ```tech load sky130A.tech``` to update the rules.

Use ```drc check``` ‚Äì violations appear as white dots on poly layers.

Inspect each violation with ```drc find```

New rules cover:

n-poly ‚Üî poly spacing

p-poly ‚Üî poly spacing

# DAY 4 
# Pre-layout Timing Analysis and Importance of Good Clock Tree 

## Theory

The following topics are addresed:
- Creation of LEF file of the previously opened inverter to be used on the PicoRV32 design
- Analysis of the grid layout in Magic
- How to make the CTS power aware? Using logic gates that can block the clock from propagating. However, the delay needs to be studied by a delay table
- FFs need a setup time depending on the combinational logic present. They are also prone to uncertainty of the clock and jittering, which should be calculated and taken into account. Based on the characteristics of the circuit, the clock needs to be calculated thinking of the uncertainty and delays
- A good strategy to route a clock tree is using the H-tree approach, as it's able to balance the clock time and is good for scaling designs
- Crosstalk of the signals should be avoided, and the clock net shielding is good to remove internal capacitances that might affect the signals
- Since there are many buffers in the clock tree, the time required for the clock to reach from a launch FF to a capture FF needs to take those middle buffer delays in consideration
- Examples of setup and hold analysis using real clocks were shown and discussed

## Lab 4

- Tracks.info used in routing stage (`/desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/openlane/sky130_fd_sc_hd`)

- Type the Command in tkcon window to set grid as tracks of locali layer
   ```grid 0.46um 0.34um 0.23um 0.17um```

 <img width="848" height="608" alt="CMOS Inverter Timing Diagram" src="https://github.com/athul-rai/Digital-VLSI-SoC-Openlane-sky130A/blob/main/Day4/115.png?raw=true" />

- Two Things to verify : Pins lies on intersections and cell width is 3. We can make use of grids to identify cell width.

- Extracting `LEF` file

  - open the mag file 
    ```magic -T sky130A.tech sky130_inv.mag &```
  - save the inverter by your custom name save `sky130_vsdinv.mag`
    then type `lef write` in tkcon window. This will create files as shown below.

- Pluging-in Custom Inverter Cell into Openlane

  - Copy the LEF file `sky130_vsdinv.lef` and `sky130_fd_sc_hd__*` from `openlane/vsdstdcelldesign/libs` to `picorv32a/src` directory.

  - add these commands into `config.tcl` in `Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a`
    ```
    set ::env(LIB_SYNTH) "$::env(OPENLANE_ROOT)/designs/picorv32a/scr/sly130_fd_sc_hd__typical.lib"

- Post-Synthesis timing analysis

  Since we are having improved timing of 0 wn. so what we will do is we will do timing analysis on Synthesis that has lot of violations
  - we gradually improve and reduce our slack by replacing cells with better one and to deliver improved delay.
  This is **timing ECO fixes**

  First we do is running the synthesis --> include newly added lef to openlane flow --> set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1 --> set                ::env(SYNTH_MAX_FANOUT) 4 --> run_synthesis
